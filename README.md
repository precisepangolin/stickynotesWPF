# sticky notes?

WIP
It was supposed to be a remake of Windows Sticky Notes in WPF, but I changed my mind and now it's probably going to be a custom notes app. Maybe.

## Features

### Current features
* Two adjustable writing panels with rich text boxes
* Togglable spellcheck (en-US)
* Character counter
* Autosave (saves both panels to local AppData folder)

### TODO
* Change spellcheck language
* Better looking UI
* Add bold, italics and underline to second box
