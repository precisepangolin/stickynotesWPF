# sticky notes?

WIP
It was supposed to be a remake of Windows Sticky Notes in WPF, but I changed my mind and now it's probably going to be a custom notes app. Maybe.

## Features

### Current features
* Two adjustable writing panels - currently one rich text box and one auxiliary simple text box
* Togglable spellcheck (en-US)
* Characters counter
* Autosave (saves to local AppData folder)

### TODO
* Autosave second panel, load second panel
* Change spellcheck language
* Better looking UI
