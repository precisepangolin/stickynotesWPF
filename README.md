# Notes App

Originally I intended to make another recreation of the Microsoft Sticky Notes (check out my other project in WinForms), but I changed my mind during development. Currently it features two adjustable writing panels with autosave and other features that are described below. You can now take notes and compare them without having to mess with multiple windows or tabs :)

## Features

### Current features
* Two adjustable writing panels with rich text boxes
* Togglable spellcheck
* Character counters
* Autosave (saves both panels to local AppData folder)
* Saved documents are automatically loaded
* Toggable dark and light mode; chosen theme is saved as default
* Line numbering

### TODO
* Add toggable autosave
* Add bullet lists
* Appearance improvement

## Screenshots

* Light mode (default)
