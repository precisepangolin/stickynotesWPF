# sticky notes?

WIP
It was supposed to be a remake of Windows Sticky Notes in WPF, but I changed my mind and now it's probably going to be a custom notes app. Maybe.

## Features

### Current features
* Two adjustable writing panels with rich text boxes
* Togglable spellcheck
* Character counters
* Autosave (saves both panels to local AppData folder)
* Loads saved documents on window load
* Switching between dark and light mode
* Line numbering

### TODO
* Add bold, italics and underline to second writing box
* Toggable autosave
* Add bullet lists
